# Real Geeks Documentation

> Here is where you will see examples!

Welcome to the Real Geeks Documentation! Here you will find useful information for building out your site. You can find the Quick Navigation in the Left Column, and examples in the right hand column.

If you have any questions, you can get in touch with us here: [Support](https://www.realgeeks.com/support/)

## Quick Start

Congratulations on your new Real Geeks site!

Here is the bare minimum that you'll need to do to set up your site:

1. Find the welcome email from Real Geeks, this will contain the site-specific information you'll need to get started.
2. Login to the accounts site from your web browser and click on your site name. This is your administration panel for editing the content on your site.
3. If you have approval from your MLS board, please contact us about going live with your site. More details including what to do with your email can be found here.

Now, of course this is the bare minimum. There are several tasks to take care of before you have a site that you would actually like people to use.

1. Create and upload a landscape image and logo to your file browser. Here are detailed instructions.
2. Configure your auto-responder and property update email signature. Here is more information on the types of emails sent by the site.
3. If you have other agents or assistants working with you, here is how to set up an agent account in the lead manager and a site builder account on the website.

# Accounts

## Logging In

> <img src="http://staging.docs.realgeeks.com/_media/accounts:login.png?w=600&tok=1ccec5"/>

The Real Geeks Login is a single sign-on system used across all of our products. If you login to the Accounts system, you are also logged in to your Real Geeks Site Admin, Lead Manager, and vice versa, provided that you have the permissions needed to access them by your Site Owner.

If you are having trouble logging in be sure to use the email you used to sign up for your account with.

If you have any questions, please contact support: [Support](https://www.realgeeks.com/support/)

## Websites

> <img src="http://staging.docs.realgeeks.com/_media/accounts:website-list.png?w=900&tok=854913"/>

Here you will find a listing of sites you own or contribute to. On the left you will find links to your Real Geeks Site Admin and the Lead Manager for that site. On the right is an “Edit/Add Users” button which will bring up permissions for each user that has been added to that site.

## User Management and Permissions

> <img src="http://staging.docs.realgeeks.com/_media/accounts:user-manager.png?w=900&tok=4ec657"/>

The User Manager gives you the ability to see an overview of each user’s permissions on the left, the ability to edit permissions, edit a user, remove a user, and add a user on the right.

### Accessing the Permissions System

> <img src="http://staging.docs.realgeeks.com/_media/accounts:add-new-user.png?w=860&tok=02067d"/>

First, if you've not used the permissions system yet or you have not yet been an administrator for the accounts system– you need to have the registered owner of the site (i.e. the person paying the bills) to proceed any further.

1. Login to https://accounts.realgeeks.com with your email and password.
2. Click on the “Websites” heading in the accounts management system. It is now, by default, your homepage.
3. Select the site you would like to modify by clicking the orange “Edit/Add Users” button on the right.
Once a site is selected, you'll be in the permissions system.
4. If the user does not yet exist, you'll then be taken to a screen that will allow you to create the new user. 

### Adding an Existing User or Creating a New User

1. Click the “Add User” button on the right-hand side of the permission system or the green button at the bottom.
2. Enter an email address for the user in the box on the left-hand side.
3. If the user already exists in the system, you will be presented with something resembling the screen below. At which point, if you click “Add Existing User” you are done.
4. If the user does not yet exist, you'll then be taken to a screen that will allow you to create the new user.
5. Finally, once the user is created or the existing user is added, you can then just begin modifying permissions.
